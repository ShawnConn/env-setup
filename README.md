A workstation provisioner powered by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) / [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for either macOS or Linux.

## Quickstart
Get started with `env-setup`:

1. Init: `bash <(curl -sL jig.io/env-setup)` 
    - or `brew install luciditi/tap/env-setup` with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Config: `env-setup -c` 
    - `none`: You want an **empty** config.
    - `mini`: You want a **minimum** config.
    - `default`: You want a **workable default** config.
    - `most`: You want it **all**.
    - `custom`: You want a **new** `config.yml` config started. (edit w/ `env-setup -e`)
3. Run: `env-setup`

## Usage

### Init
The initialize command will verify you have `git` & a SSH key to retrieve this 
repo. You'll need to allow a new SSH key in [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys) 
if not already set. It will install the tool in your home dir under `env-setup`.

### Config
The configuration yml file (`config.yml`) contains a **manifest** of Ansible _variables_ 
that define **_what should be installed in your environment_**. You can change the 
values in `config.yml` to fit what your environment setup needs.

`env-setup` has a few starter config templates from these starter scenarios:
  - `none`: You don't need an environment setup, but you want the `env-setup` tool for later use.
  - `mini`: You want a environment setup with only the basic functionality (scripts, Homebrew, & Ansible).
  - `default`: You **workable default** environment setup that will be used semi-often.
  - `most`: You want it **all** in a environment setup that you'll use often.
  - `custom`: You want a **custom** `config.yml` that you'll specify on your own (see an [example config.yml](https://gist.github.com/ShawnConn/2400705e601d6315394f0e4f01bb66b8))

If you need to manually update a `custom` config, use `env-setup -e` to edit it.

### Run
When `env-setup` is first run it will verify you have Ansible. After that, you'll
be prompted to select an Ansible _playbook_ to run. Optionally, you can specify
what playbook to run directly (e.g. `env-setup 01-config` will run the config 
playbook directly, `env-setup all` will run all playbooks in sequential order)
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

### Updating
Running `env-setup -u` will update the installed repo alongside the installed 
[dotfiles repo](https://github.com/Luciditi/env-setup-dotfiles). 

### Playbooks
An Ansible _playbook_ is a series of _tasks_ that need to run to get to your wanted setup.
`env-setup` has 8 main playbooks with other optional ones based on your needs.

- `01-config`: Configure your [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) for your app & CLI configuration (defaults to [env-setup-dotfiles](https://github.com/Luciditi/env-setup-dotfiles) if not overridden)
- `02-cli`: Install CLI tools via [Homebrew formulas](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)
- `03-apps`: Install GUI applications via [Homebrew casks](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) & other means (e.g., Linux package manager & App Store via [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas))
- `04-packages`: Install common programming language (Go/Node/PHP/Ruby/Rust/Python) dependencies for development tooling.
- `05-repos`: Clones Git repos used for active development (projects) or reference (vendors).
- `06-os`: Configure the OS settings.
- `07-cloud`: Configure the host for cloud file sync.
- `08-prefs`: Configure any other app settings.

See **custom playbook** section for adding other playbooks as needed.

### Task Info
If you like a _list_ of what _tasks_ in a playbook will do, run `env-setup -i` with 
the playbook name (e.g. `env-setup -i 03-apps`). It will print an ordered task 
list, with a description and tags that describe what the playbook will do.

### Skipping Tasks
If you'd like to _skip_ tasks in a playbook, each task have tags associated 
with them. You can **select tags** with the `-t` option or **skip tags** with the `-s` 
option. You can specify multiple tags by comma-delimiting. For example:

- `env-setup -t node,python 04-packages`: Install only **Node & Python** packages.
- `env-setup -s php 04-packages`: Install all packages, except **PHP** packages.

### Environment Variable Overrides 
There are a few environment variables that can be overridden to change behavior:

- **Init:**
    - `ENVSETUP_INTERACT`: enable interactive prompts during init (default `1`)
    - `ENVSETUP_KEY_FILE`: the SSH key path created during init (default: `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`)
    - `ENVSETUP_KEY_FILE_COMMENT`: the SSH key comment created during init (default: `env-setup:$USER@$(hostname)`)
    - `ENVSETUP_INSTALL_DIR`: the path to install env-setup during init (default: `$HOME/env-setup`)
- **RunTime:**
    - `ENVSETUP_INSTALL_DIR`: the path where env-setup looks for its config.yml files (default: `$HOME/env-setup`)
    - `ANSIBLE_SUDO`: env-setup runs ansible w/ a sudo prompt, set to `-n` to disable (default: `-K`)
    - `ANSIBLE_CHECK`: env-setup runs ansible w/ a dry-run check, set to `-C` to enable (default: ``)
    - `ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK`: env-setup runs ansible w/ a differ status update, set one of these options: `unixy | dense | debug | yaml | selective` (default: `unixy`)
    - `ANSIBLE_PLAYBOOK_INFO`: env-setup runs ansible w/ a display of playbook steps, set to `--list-tasks` to enable (default: ``)
    - `ANSIBLE_SKIPPED_TAGS`: env-setup runs ansible w/ skipping tags, set to a comma-delimited list of tags to skip (default: ``)
    - `ANSIBLE_TAGS`: env-setup runs ansible w/ specific tags, set to a comma-delimited list of tags to run (default: ``)
    - `ANSIBLE_VERBOSE`: env-setup runs ansible w/ verbosity, set to `-vvv` to enable (default: ``)

## Testing
If you'd like to have a environment for testing deployment, `env-setup` has a 
couple of scripts/tools that can help setup an environment:

- The `docker` [directory](docker) contains a `Dockerfile` that can be used to build a Ubuntu Linux docker image with `env-setup` installed w/ all the playbooks. 
    - Pre-built images can be found on [ghcr.io/luciditi/env-setup](https://github.com/Luciditi/env-setup/tree/main/docker#hosted-images). 
    - If you want a quick one-liner to test, `source <(curl -sL jig.io/dev-aliases) && dev-env` will setup an alias for `docker run ... ghcr.io/luciditi/env-setup`
- The `terraform` [directory](terraform) is a basic Terraform module that can stand up a SSH key and EC2 VMs (Linux (Ubuntu 20) & macOS (Sonoma)). 
    - Once built, there are a few [scripts](terraform/scripts) that can be used to test `env-setup` in the new VMs.
- The `vm` [directory](vm) has a couple of [scripts](vm/scripts) that can stand up Linux (Ubuntu) & macOS (Sonoma) VMs in [Tart](https://tart.run/). 
    - Run `eval "$(env-setup -A)"` to create `env-vm-*` aliases:
    - Run `env-vm-create` to create a new VM
    - Run `env-vm-start` to run the VM
    - Run `env-vm-init` to initialize the VM with `env-setup`
    - Run `env-vm-ssh` to shell into the VM
    - Run `env-vm-env-setup` to run `env-setup` inside the VM
    - Run `env-vm-stop` to stop the VM

## Custom Playbook
To get started with a custom playbook: 

- run `./scripts/add-playbook 09-my-playbook`

This will setup the directory structure in the `ansible` dir and make it 
selectable in the `env-setup` tool.

From there, you can edit:
- `ansible/*/09-my-playbook/main.yml` to add your playbook tasks
- `ansible/*/09-my-playbook/requirements.yml` to add any ansible-galaxy dependencies for the playbook.

## Development
See the development [README](DEV-README.md).
